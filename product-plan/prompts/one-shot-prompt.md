# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a complete web application based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following file:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview

After reading, also review the design assets in the product-plan folder:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All 5 section component packages

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - How should users sign up and log in? (email/password, OAuth providers, magic links?)
   - Are there different user roles with different permissions?
   - Should there be an admin interface?

2. **User & Account Modeling**
   - Is this a single-user app or multi-user?
   - Do users belong to organizations/teams/workspaces?
   - How should user profiles be structured?

3. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What backend framework/language should I use?
   - What database do you prefer?
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements?

4. **Backend Business Logic**
   - Any server-side logic, validations or processes needed beyond what's shown in the UI?
   - Background processes, notifications, or other processes to trigger?

5. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Edge cases that need clarification
   - Integration requirements

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes to add for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan broken into these milestones:

1. **Foundation** — Design tokens, data model, routing, application shell
2. **Strategy Brain** — Market sensing and budget allocation
3. **Offer & Product Cell** — Lead magnet generation
4. **Distribution Engine** — Core Four parallel execution
5. **Conversation & Sales Engine** — Lead qualification and routing
6. **Lifecycle & Compounding Engine** — Long-term nurturing

Then proceed with implementation, building milestone by milestone.
