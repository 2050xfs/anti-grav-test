# AGRD (Autonomous Growth & Revenue Department) — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement AGRD.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md` — Foundation milestone (design tokens, data model, routing, shell)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors (indigo/emerald/slate), fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono), design tokens
- `data-model/` — Core entities and TypeScript type definitions
- `shell/` — Application shell components with sidebar navigation
- `sections/` — All 5 section component packages

## How to Use This

### Option A: One-Shot (Full Implementation)

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent (Claude, GPT, etc.)
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions about auth, tech stack, etc.
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

### Option B: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
   - This includes design tokens, data model, routing, AND application shell
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

**Sections to implement (in order):**
- 02: Strategy Brain
- 03: Offer & Product Cell
- 04: Distribution Engine
- 05: Conversation & Sales Engine
- 06: Lifecycle & Compounding Engine

## What the Components Provide

All UI components are props-based React components with:
- Full styling using Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layouts
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Sample data for testing

**You need to build:**
- Backend API endpoints
- Database schema
- Authentication/authorization
- Data fetching and state management
- Business logic and validation
- Integration of callbacks to your routing

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about auth and data modeling
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context
- **Build incrementally** — Easier to catch issues and understand the system
- **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations for accuracy
- **Don't redesign the UI** — Use the provided components as-is, focus on backend integration
