# AGRD (Autonomous Growth & Revenue Department) — Product Overview

## Summary

A licensed platform that operates as an autonomous revenue department within growth-stage B2B companies. Built on proven patterns from production AI systems and Alex Hormozi's 100M Leads methodology, AGRD makes decisions, learns from every interaction, and self-improves like a senior growth team - with judgment, memory, escalation logic, and governed authority.

AGRD implements Hormozi's Core Four (Warm Outreach, Cold Outreach, Content, Paid Ads) as parallel-executing autonomous systems that compound learning across all channels. Not automation duct-taped together, but corporate intelligence that compounds at scale - doing in days what would take human teams months, while remembering every lesson learned forever.

## Planned Sections

1. **Strategy Brain** — AGRD's decision-making core that monitors markets, extracts pain points, evolves offers, and autonomously allocates budget across channels.

2. **Offer & Product Cell** — Generates high-converting lead magnets, value stacks, and core offers using Hormozi's Value Equation framework.

3. **Distribution Engine** — Executes the Core Four and Four Lead Getters as parallel autonomous systems running multi-channel campaigns simultaneously.

4. **Conversation & Sales Engine** — Handles inbound interactions with multi-input support, qualifies leads using PMAU scoring, and routes opportunities to humans or automated nurture.

5. **Lifecycle & Compounding Engine** — Treats every contact as a long-term asset with continuous nurturing, reactivation, upselling, and institutional memory that compounds across campaigns.
